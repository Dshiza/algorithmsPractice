Linear Search Implementation
To implement the Linear Search algorithm we need:

- An array with values to search through.
- A target value to search for.
- A loop that goes through the array from start to end.
- An if-statement that compares the current value with the target value, and returns the current index if the target value is found.
- After the loop, return -1, because at this point we know the target value has not been found.
